AMQP client library (protocol version 0.8)
https://github.com/zeqfreed/php_amqplib

This library is a rewrite of Simple AMQP library by Vadim Zaliva
(http://code.google.com/p/php-amqplib/).

Class layout is changed to be compatible with PSR-0 compliant class
loaders 
(https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)  
and code style should conform to Zend Coding Standard 
(http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.html).

The library is likely to evolve further in direction of more clean code
with the use of modern techniques of professional PHP.

The code is published as it, without any warranties whatsoever.
